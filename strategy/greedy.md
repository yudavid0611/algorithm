>reference: <<파이썬 알고리즘 인터뷰, 박상길, 책만>>

## Introduction
- It seeks immediate gains.
- It is used for solving optimization problems.
- Two properties
    - Greedy Choice Property: Fomer choices does not affect later choices.
    - Optimal Substructure: The optimal solution is composed of optimal solutions of subproblems.
- It can not guarantee globally optimum solutions all the time.
- Usages
    - Fractional Knapsack Problem
    - Coin-Change Problem
